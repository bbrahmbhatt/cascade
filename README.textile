h1. Cascade

Welcome to Cascade!  Cascade is a web framework for "Clojure":http://clojure.org/ that emphasizes idiomatic use of Clojure while drawing inspiration from the "Apache Tapesty":http://tapestry.apache.org web framework.

Cascade templates are an embedded DSL directly in the Clojure code; this takes some getting used to but ensures that you can take maximum advantage of Clojure when creating your application. 

Templates and actions (also Clojure functions) are linked together through a simple action framework.

See the "Cascade Wiki":http://wiki.github.com/hlship/cascade/ for more information.

h1. Status

So where's the progress?  Sorry folks, I've been busy with several large Tapestry projects, plus Tapestry 5.2, plus Project Jacob (my now 8 month old son) to make any progress on Cascade. I still have high hopes for Cascade, but I'm in the chicken-and-the-egg problem of finding a client that can directly or indirectly support its development.

h1. Authors

Cascade is a itty-bitty side project of Howard M. Lewis Ship, who should be spending more time on Tapestry.

Care to contribute?  Drop me a line!
