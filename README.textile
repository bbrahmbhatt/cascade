h1. Cascade

Welcome to Cascade!  Cascade is a web framework for "Clojure":http://clojure.org/. It is somewhat
inspired by "Tapestry":http://tapestry.apache.org/, at least as far as templates are concerned.

Our motto is "one part Tapestry template goodness and nine parts Clojure awesomeness"; in other words,
a truly functional environment for implementing web applications.

In Cascade, views are XML template files transmuted into Clojure functions. Templates can reference
fragments, which are the same (XML templates transmuted into functions). 

Rendering views and fragments is functional (that is, side-effect free) and lazy; it may also be deferred (that is,
spread across threads). I expect that Cascade will be lightning quick ... we'll see once implemented.

See the "Cascade Wiki":http://wiki.github.com/hlship/cascade/ for more information.

h1. Authors

Cascade is a itty-bitty side project of Howard M. Lewis Ship, who should be spending more time
on Tapestry.
