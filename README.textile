h1. Cascade

Welcome to Cascade!  Cascade is a web framework for "Clojure":http://clojure.org/ that emphasizes
idiomatic use of Clojure while drawing inspiration from the "Apache Tapesty":http://tapestry.apache.org
web framework.

Cascade templates are an embedded DSL directly in the Clojure code; this takes some getting used to
but ensures that you can take maximum advantage of Clojure when creating your application. 

Templates and actions (also Clojure functions) are linked together through a simple action framework.

See the "Cascade Wiki":http://wiki.github.com/hlship/cascade/ for more information.

h1. Authors

Cascade is a itty-bitty side project of Howard M. Lewis Ship, who should be spending more time
on Tapestry.
